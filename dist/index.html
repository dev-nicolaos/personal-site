        <p>
          My name is Nicolaos Skimas and I'm a web developer. I've been
          fascinated with technology and what we can create with it since I was
          young. Over the years I developed a passion for interface design and
          web development, creating intuitive projects that help people. I also
          love development because I'm constantly able to learn and grow,
          expanding my skillset by working with new tools and languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Vancouver Washington and love living in the
          Pacific Northwest. I enjoy spending my free time playing sports, doing
          outdoor activities, and spending time with my family. I'm also a big
          Star Wars fan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly, I am a Christian. I understand that apart from God I
          am a sinful human being, unable to fix myself. But because of God's
          great grace and the sacrifice of Jesus' death and resurection I am
          forgiven, free, and have new life in him.

        <p>Not unlike a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yavK0mnE3wI?t=81" rel="noopener">certain super hero</a>, web developers need a good set of tools to get the job done right. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>
