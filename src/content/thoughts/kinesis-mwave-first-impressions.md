I'm testing out the new [Kinesis mWave] keyboard and thought I'd document my first impressions. I was primarily drawn to the mWave because of its relatively low price for an ergonomic mechanical keyboard, but I also liked that it can be programmed from a browser (no need to install custom apps or firmware), and uses easily replaceable AA batteries for power when not plugged in.

For reference I've been using the [Keychron K8 Pro] for last couple years and have been mostly happy with it.

## The Good

- The plush wrist wrest feels very nice compared to the wooden Keychron one I've been using.
- The resting position of my forearms, wrists, and hands feels very natural.

## The Different

- I'm realizing I usually hit the <kbd>y</kbd> key with my left index finger and the <kbd>b</kbd> key using my right index. The mWave's split design will force me to retrain both of those habits.
- The full size number pad available on the keyboard's function layer seems like it could be really nice in certain situations, though I think it'll take a bit of getting used to.

## The Meh

The "thonk" sound and feel of each keypress is fine, but not as satisfying as the K8 Pro's. I'm not sure if this is because of the switches (both use Gateron Browns, but the mWave uses the low profile variant), the keyboard's construction, or both.

## The Bad

- The right shift key is annoyingly small.
    - This is particularly noticeable when trying to type a <kbd>?</kbd> or <kbd>"</kbd>, as the two fingers I use have to get very close together.
- Some keys around the edge of the keyboard produce a faint metallic squeaking sound when pressed.
