zoxide is a fantastic cross platform tool for more easily navigating from the command line. It feels magical to type just the beginning of a folder name rather than the entire path to that folder. I alias it as `cd` so I don't have to fight my muscle memory if I'm working on a machine or server where it isn't installed.
