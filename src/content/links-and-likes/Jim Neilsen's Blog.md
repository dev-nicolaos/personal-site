Jim's blog is a really nice read, especially if you also blog or build stuff on the web. I'm always impressed by how his posts manage to be more thoughtful and interesting than the micro posts that litter social media, but short enough that you can actually digest them in those 5 minute bits of free time that you find throughout the day.
