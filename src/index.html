           I've always been fascinated with technology and what we can create with it. Over the years I developed a passion for creating <span class="awesome">awesome user experiences</span> that are responsive, accessible, and performant. I love how being a developer allows me to continually grow and learn, and I enjoy working in collaborative environments where people can benefit from one another's experience and perspective.
        </p>

        <p class="bio_paragraph">
          I specialize more in the "front of the front-end" (HTML, CSS, accessibility, handling user interaction, etc), but also have extensive experience with JS in a variety of contexts including Express servers, React apps and more. I'm very comfortable with Git, and have a good understanding of the extensive ecosystem of tooling we have at our disposable to keep our projects tested, maintainable, and (somewhat) bug free.
        </p>

        <p class="bio_paragraph">
          I've been blessed to call Vancouver Washington and the beautiful Pacific Northwest home all my life. Outside of tech I enjoy sports, outdoor activities, Star Wars, and spending quality time with friends and family. And while those things are a part of who I am, I believe my true identity is anchored in my relationship with Christ. Apart from God I'm a sinner, woefully unable to fix myself. But because of God's great grace in sending Jesus to die for my sins I am forgiven, and I have new life in him. I believe God offers this gift freely to all people as stated in <cite>John 3:16</cite>...
        </p>

          For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
